# Welcome to Kernel

Kernel is Asimov's genetic design platform for engineering biology. It combines sequence design tools, team collaboration features, and workflow automation to accelerate the development of biotechnologies.

## Core Capabilities

### Predictive Models

Kernel includes powerful models to accelerate your design process:

* **Genetic Simulation** — Predict RNA polymerase flux, ribosome flux, and protein concentrations for your constructs
* **Compiler** — Automatically design expression vectors from antibody sequences using AI-powered codon optimization, signal peptide prediction, and expert design rules

### Genetic Design Tools

* Design genetic constructs using an intuitive, parts-based approach
* View designs in multiple formats: linear sequence, circular map, and interactive schematic
* Access integrated tools including codon optimization, biosecurity sequence analysis, and genetic simulation
* Leverage AI-assisted design support with Kernel AI

### Collaborative Workspaces

* Create team workspaces where members can collaborate on projects
* Manage construct designs, genetic parts, and notebooks in repositories with granular permissions
* Share constructs, parts, and protocols securely within and across teams
* Access public repositories:
  * Asimov Public — curated genetic parts
  * UniProt Swiss-Prot — protein sequences
  * Addgene — plasmid repository

### Automated Workflows

* Generate expression vectors automatically with the configurable genetic Compiler
* Import sequences with automatic part annotation mapping
* Run genetic simulations to predict expression behavior
* Track samples and experiments with the integrated inventory system

### Documentation & Knowledge Management

* Document experiments in electronic lab notebooks
* Create and share standardized protocols
* Link documentation, data, and images directly to sequence designs
* Search across all workspace content
