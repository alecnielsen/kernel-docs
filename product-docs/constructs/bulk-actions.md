# Bulk Actions

Perform operations on multiple constructs at once.

## Selecting Multiple Constructs

In a repository or construct list:

### Individual Selection
- **Cmd/Ctrl-click**: Add constructs to selection
- Click checkbox next to each construct

### Range Selection
- **Shift-click**: Select all constructs between clicks

### Select All
- **Cmd/Ctrl-A**: Select all visible constructs
- Or click the header checkbox

## Available Bulk Actions

### Move

Move selected constructs to another location:

1. Select constructs
2. Right-click and select **Move to...**
3. Choose destination repository/folder
4. Click **Move**

### Copy

Duplicate constructs to another location:

1. Select constructs
2. Right-click and select **Copy to...**
3. Choose destination
4. Click **Copy**

Copies are independent of originals.

### Delete

Remove selected constructs:

1. Select constructs
2. Right-click and select **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

**Warning**: Deletion cannot be undone.

### Export

Export multiple constructs:

1. Select constructs
2. Right-click and select **Export**
3. Choose format:
   - GenBank (.gb)
   - FASTA (.fasta)
   - ZIP archive of multiple files
4. Download the export

### Add to Group

Group related constructs:

1. Select constructs
2. Right-click and select **Add to group**
3. Create a new group or add to existing
4. Name the group

## Bulk Editing

### Edit Attributes

Change properties across multiple constructs:

1. Select constructs
2. Right-click and select **Edit attributes**
3. Modify shared attributes
4. Apply changes to all selected

### Change Repository Permissions

Update access for multiple constructs:

1. Select constructs in a repository
2. Access repository settings
3. Modify sharing and permissions
4. Changes apply to all contents

## Filtering Before Bulk Actions

Narrow down your selection:

### By Type
- Filter to show only constructs (not parts or notebooks)

### By Attributes
- Filter by custom attributes
- Filter by creation date
- Filter by creator

### By Search
- Search to find matching constructs
- Select from search results

## Construct Groups

### Create Group from Selection

1. Select related constructs
2. Right-click and select **Create group**
3. Name the group
4. Constructs are linked

### Group Use Cases

- **Multi-plasmid systems**: Heavy chain + light chain
- **Experimental sets**: Treatment and control constructs
- **Version sets**: Different variants of a design

### Manage Groups

1. Go to **Repos** > **All molecule architectures**
2. View and manage construct groups
3. Add or remove constructs from groups

## Tips

### Preview Before Acting
- Review your selection before bulk operations
- Check the count of selected items

### Work in Stages
- For large operations, work in batches
- Verify results between batches

### Use Filters Effectively
- Combine filters to target specific constructs
- Save common filter combinations
