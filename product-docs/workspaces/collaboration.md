# Collaboration

Work together with your team in Kernel workspaces.

## Sharing Content

### Within Your Workspace

Content in workspace repositories is accessible to workspace members based on repository permissions. No additional sharing needed.

### With External Users

Share repositories or specific content with users outside your workspace:

1. Navigate to the repository
2. Click **Share**
3. Enter the user's email or select a workspace
4. Set permission level
5. Click **Share**

## Repository Permissions

Control who can access and modify content:

| Permission | View | Edit | Admin |
|------------|------|------|-------|
| View content | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Create/edit content | No | Yes | Yes |
| Delete content | No | Yes | Yes |
| Manage sharing | No | No | Yes |
| Change settings | No | No | Yes |

### Setting Permissions

1. Open the repository
2. Click **Share** or **Settings**
3. Add members/workspaces
4. Select permission level for each
5. Save changes

## Working Together

### Real-Time Updates

Changes made by team members appear automatically:
- New constructs and parts show in repository lists
- Modifications update across all viewers
- No manual refresh needed

### Avoiding Conflicts

When multiple people edit the same construct:
- Kernel tracks revisions
- View history to see all changes
- Merge or revert if conflicts occur

### Best Practices

1. **Communicate**: Let team members know when working on shared content
2. **Use folders**: Organize by project or person
3. **Document changes**: Add descriptions to significant edits

## Notifications

Stay informed about workspace activity:

### Notification Types
- Completed simulation runs
- Shared content
- Mentions and comments
- System updates

### Managing Notifications

1. Click the notification bell in the header
2. View recent notifications
3. Click to navigate to related content

Configure notification preferences in **Settings**.

## Comments and Notes

Add context to your work:

### Construct Notes
- Add descriptions to constructs
- Document design decisions
- Note experimental results

### Notebooks
Use notebooks for:
- Detailed experimental protocols
- Analysis notes
- Project documentation

## Activity Tracking
