- Files
- Molecules
- Templates

### By Attributes

Filter using dropdowns:
- **Entity types**: Content categories
- **Created by**: Specific users
- **Repositories**: Limit to certain repos
- **Part types**: Promoter, CDS, etc.
- **Part subtypes**: Further classification
- **Molecule**: Associated molecules

### Combined Filters

Click **Show more** for additional filter options.

## Search Tips

### Exact Phrases

Search for exact phrases:

- Results match complete strings

### Partial Matching

Search matches partial names:
- "GFP" finds "GFP", "eGFP", "mCherry-GFP"
- Useful for finding variants

### Sequence Search

Find constructs containing specific sequences:
- Enter a short sequence
- Use the BLAST tool for longer sequences

## BLAST Search

For sequence similarity searches:

1. Go to **Tools** > **BLAST**
2. Enter your query sequence
3. Select search parameters
4. View matching constructs and parts

See [BLAST Search](../tools/blast.md) for details.
